# Instructions  

  ** Dynamic Memory 3 **


1. Create a ** dynamically allocated ** vector of FIXED size.  (5 for example)
2. Read a string from the keyboard
3. Store it in the vector (keep a counter)
4. When the vector hits maximum size, create a new vector of bigger size
5. Copy the original vector into the new one
6. Repeat until the user says they don't want to add any more.
7. Print out the list
8. Test this on a diffent number of strings.  Go over the limit a few times, etc

** NOTE: **
* This is an exercise in using dynamic memory.  Although the vector class CAN modify its size on request, that isn't what we are going for here.  If you don't use dynamic memory here, you will get a zero.
